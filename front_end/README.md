## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.0 or higher
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Android SDK (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development - macOS only)

### Installation

1. **Clone or Extract the Project**
   ```bash
   cd mobile_app_3
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Note: Font Files Required**
   
   This project uses custom fonts that need to be downloaded separately:
   - Poppins (Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold)
   - Inter (Regular, Medium, SemiBold)
   
   Download from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and place in:
   ```
   fonts/
   ├── Poppins-Regular.ttf
   ├── Poppins-Medium.ttf
   ├── Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
   ├── Poppins-Bold.ttf
   ├── Inter-Regular.ttf
   ├── Inter-Medium.ttf
   └── Inter-SemiBold.ttf
   ```

4. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 🧪 Testing with Mock Data

The app includes a **Mock Data Service** for testing without physical hardware.

### Enable Mock Mode
In `main.dart` or provider initialization, mock data is enabled by default. The app will simulate:
- Realistic heart rate patterns (resting, walking, running, sleeping)
- SpO2 variations
- Temperature readings
- Accelerometer and gyroscope data
- Battery drain simulation

### Test Scenarios
The mock service includes specific test scenarios:
- **Critical Heart Rate** - Triggers emergency alerts
- **Low SpO2** - Simulates low oxygen levels
- **High Fever** - Tests temperature alerts
- **Emergency HR** - Tests emergency protocols

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### Key Tables
- `users` - User authentication data
- `user_profile` - Personal info, health conditions, goals
- `raw_sensor_data` - Real-time vital signs from device
- `wellness_metrics` - Daily aggregated health metrics
- `alerts` - Health alerts and notifications
- `sessions` - Workout session data
- `nutrition_log` - Food intake tracking

---

## 🔐 Authentication

### Test Users
Since this is a demo, create a test account:
1. Tap "Sign Up" on login screen
2. Fill in registration form
3. Complete 3-step onboarding:
   - Personal info (age, gender, weight, height)
   - Health history
   - Goals setting

### Security Features
- SHA-256 password hashing
- Secure storage (flutter_secure_storage)
- Session management
- Database cascade delete on account removal

---

## 📱 Key Screens

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login Screen** - Gradient design with animated entrance
2. **Sign Up Screen** - Registration with validation
3. **Onboarding** - 3-step personalization flow

### Main App
1. **Home Dashboard** - Activity summary, live vitals, quick actions
2. **Vitals Detail** - Historical charts for HR, SpO2, temperature
3. **Daily Activity** - Steps, distance, calories, active minutes
4. **Alerts** - Health notifications with severity levels
5. **Profile** - User info, BMI, goals, settings
6. **Start Session** - Real-time workout tracking
7. **Settings** - App configuration, device pairing

## ⚠️ Health Alert System

### Alert Severities

**🚨 EMERGENCY (Red)**
- Heart Rate: >200 or <30 bpm
- SpO2: <80%
- **Action:** Immediate notification + "Call 911" recommendation

**⚠️ CRITICAL (Orange)**
- Heart Rate: >180 or <40 bpm
- SpO2: 80-90%
- Temperature: >39°C
- **Action:** High-priority notification + medical attention recommendation

**⚠️ WARNING (Yellow)**
- Elevated resting HR
- SpO2: 90-95%
- Mild fever: 37.5-39°C
- **Action:** Standard notification + monitoring recommendation

**ℹ️ INFO (Blue)**
- Achievement notifications
- Motivational messages
- Daily tips

---

## 🎯 Wellness Score Calculation

The app calculates a holistic wellness score (0-100) based on:
- **Sleep Quality** (25%) - Hours and patterns
- **Activity Level** (25%) - Steps, active minutes, workouts
- **Vital Signs** (25%) - HR, SpO2, temperature stability
- **Nutrition** (25%) - Calorie intake, macronutrient balance

---

## 🔗 Cloud Integration (TODO)

The app includes placeholder methods for cloud synchronization:
- `CloudApiService` - REST API client structure
- `uploadSensorData()` - Bulk upload vitals
- `analyzeFood()` - AI image recognition for nutrition
- `getAIInsights()` - Personalized health recommendations

**Note:** Implement your own backend API and update the `baseUrl` in `services/cloud_sync_service.dart`.

## 📦 Package Dependencies

Core packages used:
```yaml
google_fonts: ^6.1.0           # Typography
flutter_blue_plus: ^1.30.0     # Bluetooth
sqflite: ^2.3.0                # Local database
provider: ^6.1.0               # State management
fl_chart: ^0.65.0              # Charts
flutter_local_notifications    # Alerts
flutter_secure_storage         # Secure credentials
uuid: ^4.2.0                   # Unique IDs
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Build Errors**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

**2. Font Not Found**
- Download required fonts and place in `fonts/` directory
- Ensure `pubspec.yaml` font paths are correct

**3. Database Errors**
- Delete app and reinstall to reset database
- Or use: `await DatabaseService().clearAllData()`

**4. Bluetooth Not Working**
- Ensure device permissions are granted
- Check if mock mode is enabled (no real device needed)
- Android: Enable location permissions (required for BLE)
